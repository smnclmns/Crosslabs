# Crosslabs 

is a project to give students an easy start for creating their first automation in the lab using an Arduino mircocontroller.

## Basic Idea

In this Web Application the students can write algorithms in an easy pseudo-code syntax. As a result they get the UML Version of their **activity diagramm**.
For ease, there will be a lot of given functions that are explained and kann be easily used in the script.

## Level Structure

1. Reading sensordata
-> Task: Understanding of how to read and interprete the sensordata

2. Recognizing the equivalence point
-> Task: Learn how to interpret light sensor data to determine the equivalence point in titration.

3. Pump control
-> Task: Learn how to control the pump to start and stop the flow of titration solution as well as calibrate motor steps to a volume output

4. Proper timing
-> Task: Understand how to program the Arduino script to control the timing of the pump to ensure accurate and efficient titration.

5. Titration automation
-> Task: Learn how to combine the previous tasks to create a fully automated titration process.
